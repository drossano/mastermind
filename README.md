# Mastermind
This is a project is part of [The Odin Project's]<https://www.theodinproject.com/> Ruby curriculum.

## Description
The goal of this project was to recreate the boardgame [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) in Ruby. The game is played by having one player play as the "Codemaker" whom makes a 4 peg secret code from 6 different colored pegs. The other player plays as the "Codebreaker" and has 12 attempts to guess that code. Upon guessing, the Codebreaker tells the Codebreaker how many of the guessed colors are in the code and how many of them are in the correct position.

## Instructions
Mastermind is a one player game where a player can decide to play against a computer in either the Codemaker or Codebreaker roles. In order to adapt the game to the console the pegs have been substituted with numbers ranging from 1-6.

The game can either be played on [replit](https://replit.com/@drossano1/Mastermind#main.rb) or by downloading the files and running the Game.rb file.
